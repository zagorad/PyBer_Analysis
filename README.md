# *PyBer_Analysis*

## *Overview of the Analysis* ##
With the knowledge of Python and Pandas, a DataFrame summary was created using the ride-share data by city. Then with MatPlotLib a multi-line graph was created that shows total weekly fare for each city type.
We were then asked to find the total number of rides, total fares for each city type, and total number of drivers, to get this data I used the “sum”, “count”, and “groupby” function. 

## *Results* ##

  -This table shows that there was a total of 2,973 drivers and they were split between Rural, Suburban and Urban demographics areas.

  - This table shows Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver based on the three different demographics areas.

    - The multiple line graphs show’s that between January 2019 to April 2019, the urban cities are the highest grossing, then suburban and last the rural.
  

     
    
   ## ** Recommendations
   
   The three recommendation I would suggest are:
-	See what causes the spikes on the graph, as the demand is probably higher at those specific times and then increase the prices.
-	Lower the number of Urban drivers, as they are more drivers than riders. 
-	Add coupons or some sort of lower pricing when the demand is low to potentially increase rides.
